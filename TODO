problems:
	1. deploy doesn't recognize zsh-antigen installed
	2. sudo apt install zsh-antigen installs antigen in /usr/share/zsh-antigen . This might cause problems for non-root access deploments, even the sudo causes problems
	3. not sure if powerline/fonts needs installation

TODO:
	1. currently commented out tmux startup in zsh/zshrc_manager.sh. while this can be usefull, but it may cause problems over ssh. check on that
	2. running zsh/antigen.zsh in the end of zsh/zsh_manager.sh instead of the original zsh/zshrc.sh. have to customize zsh, antigen style. prompt.sh, keybindings.sh, etc not configured in zsh/antigen.zsh
