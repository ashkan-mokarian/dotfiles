problems:
	1. deploy doesn't recognize zsh-antigen installed
	2. sudo apt install zsh-antigen installs antigen in /usr/share/zsh-antigen . This might cause problems for non-root access deploments, even the sudo causes problems
	3. not sure if powerline/fonts needs installation

TODO:
	1. consider using Vundle for vim plugin management
